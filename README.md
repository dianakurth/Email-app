To run this code correctly you need gensim, nltk, numpy, pytz and PySide2 libraries installed. <br />
Code allows to log into your email account (if you use gmail, wp or interia) and read and send emails. It also has an autoresponder that sends an automatic message to all emails received since the last refresh. It also allows searching for emails by keyword and by contextual similarity. <br />
